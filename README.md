- *Profiles App* This application handles user management, including registration, profile updates, and deletion. It inherits functionality from the Django framework for login and registration. Users can specify their interests during registration, which helps tailor their experience. The app also includes a notification system to alert users of new events and a chat system for real-time communication between users in the same course. 

- *Activities App* This application manages information about events and courses. Users can browse available events and courses, register, and book seats. The app supports CRUD operations for events and courses, and authorized users can manage these activities comprehensively, including viewing and exporting booking data.

### üíª Download Repo

If you don't have Git installed on your system, follow these steps to install it:

#### Windows

4. Verify the installation by running the following command in the command prompt or PowerShell:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```
#### MacOS

1. Open the terminal.

2. Install Git using Homebrew (if you don't have Homebrew, follow the instructions at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)):

## üîã Setup and first drinks

In the following lines you can find some commands necessary to set up the development environment for the web platform.

After cloning the repo:
``` bash
cd SpritzCollege 
```

``` bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations Profiles
python3 manage.py makemigrations Activities
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

``` bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```
Now you are ready to start:
``` bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

*SpritzCollege* users can communicate with each other via chat, based on WebSocket and django-channels. 
To use it, docker must be installed. Then, using the following command, start the redis channel layer, as <a href="https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/part_2.html">described here</a>.
``` bash
docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5
```
*Now you can make the most of the potential of the best orange platform in the world.*

If you want to do the first tests to check: 
``` bash
python3 manage.py test Activities
```
 
## üî© Load sample data
You can load data in several ways.
If you want to load data such as "first startup",
the advice is to execute these first commands.

``` bash
python3 manage.py up_user
```

``` bash
python3 manage.py up_activities
```
What will happen?

- Users will be created (as shown in the table below)
- Test events will also be created, which you can sign up for and which you can view bookings and brochures for.

Please note: for chat to work, you need to have Docker installed and running, and follow the command above.

## üìë SpritzCollege in Production üìä
Be careful: <br>
- If you are testing the functions of the platform, if not necessary I recommend you comment the call to `db_checkStatus_scheduledEvent()` in <a href="SpritzCollege/SpritzCollege/urls.py">urls.py</a>. Tests run with in `db_checkStatus_scheduledEvent()` will be an infinite loop, and other features may not behave as expected.
- In <a href="SpritzCollege/SpritzCollege/urls.py">urls.py</a> you can use `db_pialla()` only when you want to delete all content and data from the database; in alternative, you can call this function `db_delete()`. 
- In <a href="SpritzCollege/SpritzCollege/urls.py">urls.py</a>, remember to call `db_checkStatus_scheduledEvent()` when you're in the production phase.
